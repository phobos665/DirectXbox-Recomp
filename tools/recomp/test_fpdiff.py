"""The lifted C must agree with the CPU on the x87/SSE/MMX forms below.

Runs tools.recomp.fpdiff on DOA3's hot forms and on every form a fix in the
lifter made agree. Skipped without a 32-bit MSVC, like tools.conformance, so
it never blocks a run on macOS, Linux or a Windows machine with no compiler.

By hand, for every case or a subset and with the mismatches printed:
